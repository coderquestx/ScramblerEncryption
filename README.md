## Features

- **Custom Scrambling Algorithm**: A straightforward encryption technique.
- **Lightweight**: Pure Java implementation with no external libraries.
- **Symmetric Encryption**: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **Easy Integration**: Suitable for educational purposes, small projects, or simple use cases.

---

## Use Cases

- **Basic Obfuscation**: Hide sensitive data from plain view.
- **Learning Tool**: Understand encryption principles through a simple implementation.
- **Lightweight Security**: Add basic security to data in transit or at rest.

## Usage

### Basic Example
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String originalText = "Hello, World!";
        String key = "mySecretKey";

        String encryptedText = ScramblerEncryption.encrypt(originalText, key);
        System.out.println("Encrypted Text: " + encryptedText);

        String decryptedText = ScramblerEncryption.decrypt(encryptedText, key);
        System.out.println("Decrypted Text: " + decryptedText);
    }
}
